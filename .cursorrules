# Cursor Rules for hb's dotfiles workspace

## Terminal Commands
- When using `cat` command, always use `cat --paging=never` or `cat -P` because `cat` is aliased to `bat` which opens a pager by default
- Alternative: Use `/bin/cat` to bypass the alias entirely

## Coding Style
- Prefer concise, well-documented scripts
- Use meaningful variable names
- Always include error handling in shell scripts
